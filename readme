Feature Edge Detector
***************************


Feature Edge Detector is a collection of tools for edge detection in images, based on ITK.
It is a bit different from standard edge detectors in the sense that it must first **learn** the characteristics of an edge, on a known image. The summary of this learning is the **feature edge**.It can then apply this knowledge and **test** the feature edge on an unknown image.


Work in progress.
